            <p align="center">
                Is one of the biggest questions that comes to mind when we really, truly think about the value of art: can art make a difference? Many movements in art history have tried to change society in one way or another: Dada artists advocated
                for silliness and nonsensical behaviour in daily life as the only response to the horrors of the First World War. Fluxus sought to "promote a revolutionary flood and tide in art, promote living art, anti-art" through its network of
                international artists. And groups like the Situationist International played a major role in the revolutionary Paris events of 1968 by exposing the divisions between artists, consumers, and the means of production. And of course art
                can take the form of protest, addressing political and social issues with direct action. So we know that art movements can change society, but what about art today? Are there works of art that have changed the way you think or feel
                about something? Can all of those small changes add up to something bigger?
